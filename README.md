# Aviation in Palestine

Project supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) under the Grant Agreement No. 219698. For further information, please visit “Sea-Border and Air-Space Formation in the Interwar Middle East: A Trans-Imperial Perspective”: https//data.snf.ch/grants/grant/219698

This project will map aviation lines running through Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1945. Using Geovis, QGIS, and a relational model, it collates all available information about civil and military aviation running through Palestine. First, it presents Palestine's role in facilitating imperial and regional aviation by mapping all landing grounds and airports in the territory and the aviation companies that made use of them. 

Second, it facilitates the intergration of aviation into the longer history of transportation in the region by superimposing airports and landing grounds with other types of transportation infrastructure, primarily sea ports, railways, and roads. 

Thirdly, it tracks the way border control agencies intervened in, and sought to regulate, cross-border movement.

A second, later, stage of this project will make use of prosopographical tools to disaggregate aviation companies. It will seek information regarding aviation companies' employees, boardmembers, and stockholders, and use that material to facilitate a network model of actors involved in aviation in the region and complicate homogenizing national identifications of aviation companies as "british" or "egyptian" or "zionist" or "dutch" or "polish" or "italian".
